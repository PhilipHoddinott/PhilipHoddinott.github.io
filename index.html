Aerospace Structures and Materials
•	Structures under combined shear, bending, and torsional loads. Effects of taper and cutouts, shear deformations and warping, and torsion of multicell sections.

Introduction to computational tools for complex equilibrium and kinetic calculations. Application to problems such as pollutant formation
Computational Fluid Dynamics
•	Course focuses on computational approaches to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Course assumes knowledge of numerical methods and therefore directly attacks the obstacles to applying these methods to the Navier-Stokes equations. Issues concerning implementation of finite difference methods (FDM), finite volume methods (FVM) and finite element methods (FEM) will be discussed. These issues include: the discrete formulation, nonlinear equation iterator (steady)/marcher (time-accurate), linear equation formation, boundary condition prescription, and linear equation solution.
Elements of Mechanical Design
•	Design of mechanical components and integrated assemblies including shafts, couplings, bearings, gears, clutches, brakes, screws, and bonded joints. Loads, stresses, strains, FEA, failure phenomena and material selection. Laboratory component involves testing of concepts and reverse engineering of mechanical assemblies.

•	Circuit variables, analysis of resistive circuits. Network theorems (Kirchhoff's law, Ohm's law, Norton and Thevenin equivalent). Ammeters, voltmeters, and ohmmeters. Analysis methods (nodal and mesh analysis, linearity, superposition). Dependent sources and OpAmps. Energy Storage elements. First-order circuits.
Electric Circuits 2
•	Second-order circuits. Sinusoidal sources and phasors. AC steady-state analysis. AC steady-state power. Laplace transform. Circuit analysis in the s-Domain. Frequency response. Mutual inductance and transformers. Two-port circuits.
Electric Circuits 1&2

This includes pressure and velocity measurement techniques, hot wire anemometry, demonstrations of Particle Imaging Velocimetry, flow visualizations, tunnel characterization, laboratory instrumentation, errors and noise in measurements, digital sampling, and comparison of measured data with theoretical and computational predictions
Mechanical Systems Lab
•	Laboratory experience to complement Elements of Mechanical Design. Laboratory involves stress and strain measurement; load, fatigue, and failure testing; friction and wear behavior; reverse engineering of a mechanical assembly. 
Introduction to Engineering Design
•	Engineering design with emphasis on creativity, teamwork, communication, and work across engineering disciplines. Students are introduced to the design process through a semester-long project which provides a design-build-test experience. Multiple team presentations and reports. Oral and written communication are important elements of the course.
Introduction to Numerical Methods for Differential Equations
•	Derivation, analysis, and use of computational procedures for solving differential equations. Topics covered include ordinary differential equations (both initial value and boundary value problems) and partial differential equations. Runge-Kutta and multistep methods for initial value problems. Finite difference methods for partial differential equations including techniques for heat conduction, wave propagation, and potential problems. Basic convergence and stability theory.

Rigid body dynamics with application to gyrodynamics, stabilized platforms, gravity-gradient and spin stabilization of satellites. Vehicle launch and reentry, deployment dynamics, used MATLAB and Systems Tool Kit.
Space Vehicle Design
•	Introduction to all elements of the spacecraft design process from proposal preparation through detailed specification and prototyping via semester long design team project. Topics include problem definition and requirement analysis, design specifications, concept development, reliability, consideration of alternative solutions, materials considerations, engineering prototyping, mission analysis, and presentation skills.

<div class="dropdown">
	<span><strong>Spacecraft Navigation, and </strong></span>
<div class="dropdown-content">
    <p>This course studies the methods used to determine the translational and rotational states of a typical spacecraft. Review of the most common sensors used for spacecraft navigation, including: radiometric data, cameras, inertial measurement units, and star trackers. Detailed mathematical models will be developed for each of these. Students will study the most common methods for fusing asynchronous and dissimilar sensor data to create a statistically optimal estimate of the spacecraft six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) state. Students will derive and implement both batch filters and sequential filters (e.g. extended Kalman filter). Students will learn when it is best to use different types of estimation algorithms for space missions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="dropdown">
	<span><strong>Mechatronics</strong></span>
	<div class="dropdown-content">
		<p>The synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, electronics, control engineering, and computer science in the design process. The key areas of mechatronics studied in depth are control sensors and actuators, interfacing sensors and actuators to a microcomputer, discrete controller design, and real-time programming for control using the C programming language. The unifying theme for this heavily laboratory-based course is the integration of the key areas into a successful mechatronic design.</p>
